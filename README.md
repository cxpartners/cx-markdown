# cxpartners blog post preview magic

Format text with Markdown, see it styled with cxpartners' brand typography

## Why should I use Markdown?

[Read this please](why-markdown.md)


## Pre-requisites

- An OSX 10.7+ / Yosemite-ready Mac
- A brain with words and partially formed ideas in it

Plus either:

- Curiousity about Markdown
- An ambition to quickly draft beautifully formatted, well structured blog posts for the [cxpartners website](http://www.cxpartners.co.uk)

## How to use

- Download and install [Mou](http://25.io/mou/), a small and lovely Markdown editor for Mac. (The 0.8.7 beta is free.)
- On a Mac, pop the `cx-markdown.css` file into Library > Application Support > Mou > CSS directory. On a PC, all the very best with that.
- Launch Mou and open Preferences > CSS and select cx-markdown.css
- Write content with Markdown and watch it get automagically styled with something very close to the latest CSS for blog posts on the cxpartners website
- Write insightful stuff y'hear?
- Or just mess about, get a feel for Markdown, see how fun it is, wean yourself off that WYSIWYG habit
- Try hacking the `creating_the_cxpartners_design_manual.md` example around if you're not sure where to start

## Roadmap

- See if we can make the preview more realistic
  - Bundle blockquote styles
- Figure out how to generate the CSS without error-prone manual interventions
- Create extra demo page with more exhaustive formatting examples
- People need the fonts too yeah? Licensing though.
- Where do images come from?
- I clearly haven't thought this through have I?
- Make it all better

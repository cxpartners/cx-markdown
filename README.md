# mou
CSS for previewing Markdown with cxpartners article formatting

## How to use

- Download and install [Mou](http://25.io/mou/)
- On a Mac, pop the customised `cx-markdown.css` file into Library > Application Support > Mou > CSS directory. On a PC, all the very best with that.
- Launch Mou and open Preferences > CSS and select cx-markdown.css
- Write content with Markdown and watch it get automagically styled with something very close to the latest CSS for blogposts the cxpartners website
- Write insightful stuff y'hear?
- Try hacking the `creating_the_cxpartners_design_manual.md` example around if you'\'re not sure where to start

## Roadmap

- Make the CSS less crude
- Make it all better
- Add extra demo page with more formatting examples
- People need the fonts too yeah? Licensing.
- I clearly haven't thought this through have I?

# Markdown examples

There's an [exhaustive list of options here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), although those docs were written in a bygone age when small fonts were the norm. (I recommend hammering Apple + plus a few times to make it much easier on the eye.) 

Here are a few examples to whet your appetite:



I like to **make stuff bold** and add _emphasis_ just for laffs.

You want links? Here is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link. [This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute however (why would it?).

Here follows a horizontal rule:

# This is an H1

## This is an H2

### This is an H3

> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
> 
> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

An unordered (typically bulleted) list:

* Red
* Green
* Blue

So is this:

- Green
- Blue
  - Nested purple
- Red

Ordered (numbered) lists use numbers followed by periods, or full stops if you'd rather:

1.  Bird
2.  McHale
3.  Parish

Oh, you want images too? Take this and party: ![Don't fortget your alt text now](http://placehold.it/350x150 "Lovely stuff")

That's just scratching the surface. Mou comes with a smashing Markdown Syntax Reference pane. Just look in the Help menu or hit Apple +R.

# Why should I use Markdown?

Great typography supports readability, usability, enhances content, creates engaging, memorable user experiences. It gets your message across more powerfully than bad typography. It radiates brand values. Great typography on the web requires well-formed and appropriate HTML.

Great accessibility on the web requires well-formed and appropriate HTML too.

I won't even mention how good SEO requires well-formed and appropriate HTML.

Well-formed and appropriate HTML is a kinda **big deal** on the web, no getting away from it.

The web is world wide today because the barrier to entry for HTML was set deliberately low (its ease of authoring engendered its ubiquity).

Nonetheless it requires a little bit of knowledge and care to do HTML _well_, especially if you aspire to high production values. This can feel a bit intimidating for some people who want to publish on the web. 

That's OK, HTML is _code_ after all and probably looks mysterious and daunting if you're not used to working directly with code (ie. you're part of a rapidly diminishing but still statistically vast proportion of the human race). Maybe you don't have the confidence or time or energy to learn _another new thing_ right now. That's OK too, we all have finite resources and code is just a means to an end.

People have invented ways to hide HTML from code-averse web authors. Rich text WYSIWYG ("[what you see is what you get](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)") editors are the most pervasive example of this. 
 
They are a bit "magic". They make it all feel OK.

But remember the "well-formed and appropriate HTML is a big deal on the web" bit you nodded at above? Do you still care about that? Do you still subscribe to those production values? Consider this:

- WYSIWYG editors allow you to conveniently overlook all of that
- You can use all the wrong HTML *as long as it "looks right" at the time*
- They encourage you to do bad stuff. In most [popular CMSes](https://wordpress.com/) they tend to come with lots of tools attached that squirt large blocks of unchecked proprietary HTML into your content
- WYSIWYG rich text editors encourage you to cross the streams and violate one of the core principles of good content strategy – [separating presentation from content](http://karenmcgrane.com/2014/03/27/separating-content-from-presentation/)
- They make a mockery of the idea that you can COPE ([Create Once, Publish Anywhere](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/2009/10/13)). That idea is six years old now, we should take it for granted, But you simply can't do it if you mix content and presentation.


You know content strategy is important, right? You should take that seriously. This isn't just a developer's lament you're reading.

WYSIWYG editors are beguiling. They create an illusion of cause & effect. It's a shaky premise at best. I've just helped to migrate a website and needed to reformat hundreds of mungy WYSIWYG-authored articles because the content was inextricably tied to what you saw then, not what you should see now.

To boot, they are often buggy 

## Let's take a reality check – WYSIWYG is a false economy

The masqerade of convenience comes at a cost to your business:

- Your developers could be spending their time getting that killer new feature to market
- Your content teams are duplicating effort desperately trying to publish in multiple places and create consistent cross-channel experiences. Some of it looks a bit crummy to be honest. The outcome doesn't match the vision. 

We need to wean ourselves off WYSIWYG editors. 

Let's embrace some constraints and focus on what matters. Then we can make the outcome match the vision.

## How is Markdown better?

Because it makes authors think about content structure not presentation. That's right isn't it? Content people thinking about content. Separation of concerns, just like that. Everything else just falls into place.

## Isn't it hard to use?

It's plain text, not rich text, and has a small and gentle learning curve. 

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) was created to enable people "_to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid HTML_". 

That sounds alright doesn't it? Here's more:

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. 

It is becoming increasingly ubiquitous – which means there's plenty of [documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) out there and open source tools like [Mou](http://25.io/mou/), the extraordinary goodness of [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor) and [78 others](http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/) that help you to get to grips with its simple, charming pleasures. 

There are lots of people who will help too if you just ask. Follow the [simple steps here](/README.md) to it a try.
